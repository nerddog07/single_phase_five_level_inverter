Simulation ,design and hardware implementation of Single Phase Five Level Inverter based on switched capacitance cell topology for PV applications

# Project Preview
Multilevel inverters are power electrical devices that can use several lower level DC voltages as inputs to
produce the desired output. Because they can create a smoother stepped output waveform, multilevel
inverters are becoming more and more preferred than traditional two level inverters. Additionally, the
output from multilevel inverters has fewer harmonic distortions and dv/dt. Typically, diode clamped,
flying capacitor, or cascaded H-bridge topologies are used in multilevel inverters. These topologies include
drawbacks such a huge number of components, high size, expense, and complexity of control. The purpose
of this project is to utilise a switched capacitance (SC) structure to get around the drawbacks of the
current topologies. This project work involves the simulation and hardware implementation of switched
Capacitor Step Up Single Phase 5 Level Inverter for PV applications.
