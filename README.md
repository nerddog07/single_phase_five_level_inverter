Simulation ,design and hardware implementation of Single Phase Five Level Inverter based on switched capacitance cell topology for PV applications

# Project Preview
Multilevel inverters are power electrical devices that can use several lower-level DC voltages as inputs to
produce the desired output. Because they can create a smoother stepped output waveform, multilevel
inverters are becoming more and more preferred than traditional two-level inverters. Additionally, the
output from multilevel inverters has fewer harmonic distortions and dv/dt. Typically, diode-clamped,
flying capacitor or cascaded H-bridge topologies are used in multilevel inverters. These topologies include
drawbacks such as a huge number of components, large size, expense, and control complexity. The purpose
of this project is to utilize a switched capacitance (SC) structure to get around the drawbacks of the
current topologies. This project involves the simulation and hardware implementation of a switched
Capacitor Step Up Single Phase 5 Level Inverter for PV applications.
